How to use:
Step 1: Place LineSaver.py in an easy to access place, such as a Quick Access tab. Then place it inside an empty folder. Trust me.
Step 2: Make an input.txt file and place it in the same folder as LineSaver.py.
Step 3: Run program and read Caution. If you wish to cancel, type anything BUT "y". The script should close.
Step 4: Wait for it to finish and close a few unimportant windows. 

The program will read a bunch of disk and will output each line individually to its own .txt file, named using hex.
There is a max of 65536 that I know of. It may be incorrect but unless you're doing something stupid, 65k is more than enough.
